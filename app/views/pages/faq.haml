        WHY DOES THIS THING EXIST?
      %p
        We've setup the Exploraboratorium to discover answers to a tricky question - how can Comic Relief make use of the rapid changes in digital media to create new products and services that can make, or raise money for Comic Relief and our causes, 365 days a year?

      %p
        The basic concept behind the Exploralaboratorium is simple - to build a process that helps us move from good ideas to tangible, testable prototypes as quickly as possible. Moving quickly means we can get products into customers hands more quickly, which means we can learn about what works and doesn't work more quickly. In other words, it means that we can fail more quickly - and we think that faster failure will lead to faster success.

      %p
        The project is being run by the innovation team at Comic Relief, in collaboration with

        WHAT IS THE PROCESS OF MAKING THE HACKS AND STUFF? 

      %p
        We're developing the process as we go, but we think that there are three basic activities that the Exploralaboratorium can do to hep create new digital stuff that can raise money for Comic Relief 365 days a year.

      %h3
        1. Gathering and evaluating ideas

      %p
        We're gathering ideas by speaking to people across the business, and asking for suggestions via the website. Our main evaluation criteria are that the idea should have a simple hypothesis about how the resulting product could make or raise money 365 days a year, that it fits with Comic Relief's mission, and that is has a clear project sponsor.

      %h3
        2. Making hacks, and then supporting their validation with consumers

      %p
        We'll then spend between one and five days hacking the idea into a digital thing - this means a working piece of software that in some clear way allows the person who came up with the idea to test and explore their assumptions and hypothesis around the idea with real users.

      %p
        We then pass the hack to the product owner, who is responsible for testing it and getting feedback from users, in order to validate (or not) their assumptions about the idea. They'll be supported by a member of the Comic Relief innovation team in doing this.

      %p
        Once the product owner has gathered feedback its decision time. Either they can pivot the idea to a new one and get us to hack a second iteration, or they can pull out and kill the idea, or they can persevere and turn the idea into a full blown product. The key thing is that the decision will (and must) be supported by real evidence of user desire or intent. For example, user did click the donate button, or they did recommend it to a friend, or they did sign up for a newsletter - etc etc.

      %h3
        3. Helping move the concept from hack to real product

      %p
        If the idea is well validated - say it does get people to donate, or recommend it to their friends, or some other key metric - we can then support the product owner in writing a full business case and begin the full process of product development to create a full supported digital thing that raises money 365 days a year for Comic Relief.

        WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY A 'DIGITAL PRODUCT OR SERVICE'

      %p
        Broadly speaking we mean a digital thing that people pay for, or that they use to do something useful for themselves. Basically software, but software that is well designed and does something good. Digital products are everywhere - think of Gmail, the apps on your phone, Spotify, Instagram - all these things are digital things that people pay for in some way.
